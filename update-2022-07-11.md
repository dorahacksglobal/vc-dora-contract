### DOR-04 | Discussion About `slopeChanges[epoch]` In Function `_checkPoint()`

First, `slopeChanges[epoch]` is not always 0.

`slopeChanges` records the change of total balance at each epoch. Consider a situation: there are multiple users whose staking ends in the same epoch. At this point the `slopeChanges` of the epoch (in the future) will not be 0.

But the index of `slopeChanges` is currently used incorrectly. It should be `slopeChanges[epoch]` but not `slopeChanges[timestamp (epoch * WEEK)]`.

Incorrect usage in `_supplyAt()` has also been fixed.
